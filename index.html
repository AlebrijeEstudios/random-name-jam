          <h1>What?</h1>
          <p>Recently, <http://videogamena.me> made some buzz on Twitter. So [@pstn_](https://twitter.com/pstn_), [@peterschueler](https://twitter.com/peterschueler) and [@lnwdr](https://twitter.com/lnwdr) came up with the idea of making actual games out of the random names from that site.</p>
          <p>And of course, everone is welcome to join us!</p>
          
          <h1>Where?</h1>
          <p>Whereever you want. To keep organization simple, we won't meet in person.</p>
          
          <h1>When?</h1>
          <p>From 2015-03-23 00:00:00 to 2015-03-29 23:59:59.</p>
          
          <h1>The Rules</h1>
          <p>Anyone interested in participating should add their Github username to the list below via pull request.</p>
          <p>Hit the EDIT button on [this page](https://github.com/lnwdr/random-name-jam/edit/gh-pages/index.html), copy the empty list entry and create a pull request.</p>
          
          <p>When the jam starts, you will be given 3 random game names, from which you pick one and develop a game with that name.</p>
          
          <p>You can pick any platform you like but of course it'd be nice, if as many people as possible can actually play sour game.</p>
          
          <p>When the deadline comes, there will be a new list here for the finished games. Again, add yours via pull request, just as before.</p>
          
          <p><strong>This is not a contest.</strong> There will be no winner, no prize, just games.</p>
